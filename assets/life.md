# Memento Mori

People ought to live with balance.

- Mind
- Body
- Soul

Neglecting any one of these three will result in a critical imbalance.
Neither can they be regarded in isolation - we are all a gestalt, a
whole greater than the sum of our interconnected parts. None of these
areas should wither from lack of care.

- Mind - Education, fed with good problems
- Body - Exercise, fed with good nutrition
- Soul - Faith, fed with good wisdom

You must also remember that you will die. As taught in Kerouac's On
the Road, it is sometimes important to be childlike and see life with
new and fascinated eyes, totally enraptured by the present and your
physical senses.

What all of this comes down to is striking a good balance between
these three components - and with these life manuals, I hope to record
my methods for each.

Be **pragmatic**. Be **well fed**. Be **wise**. May God bless you.
