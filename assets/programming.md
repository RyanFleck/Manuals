**Programming is tough.** Especially at first.

Whatever you are learning or writing, keep in mind that every language
was created with a set of principles and use cases in mind - *some
more than others.*

**Learn to reject your ego.** Learn to love burning code.

Name things what they are. **Begin with your program's final state in mind!**
