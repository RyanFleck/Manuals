# This is Not Financial Advice

If you follow any of this, you are entirely responsible for any gains
or losses that you experience. **I hold no accountability.** Thanks.

# Fear & Greed

When people see *"green line go up"*, they want in on the action.
Depending on the timing, this is either an OK or a **bad** time to buy
an asset. It is rare that, having gone up a double-digit percentage,
any asset will continue upwards without considerable momentum or reason.

- Don't pile money into assets when the market is green, people are
  bragging about their investments, and greed is high.
- Don't sell everything when the market is red, people are complaining
  about their losses, and fear is high.

This is how chumps, suckers, and those manipulated by FUD[^fud] think. Use
the [Fear & Greed](https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed) index
as a tool to help judge the market. Better put by *Warren Buffett*[^1]:

- *"Be fearful when others are greedy."*
- *"Be greedy **only** when others are fearful."*

# Precious Metals

Unless the world is about to collapse, holding a great deal of
physical precious metals is unnecessary - though holding none is
unwise. As a rule of thumb, at minimum, hold a few months' of expenses
worth of gold and silver. Ideally half a year's worth.

Never ever buy paper metals - stock or crypto - ever, but especially
with the expectation that it will be available in a time of crisis.

# The Stock Market

**Generally, a losing game.** Picking stocks takes time and highly patient
and systematic thinking to see consistent long-term returns. Read
these. Pay attention to what politicians are investing in.

**Avoid mutual funds.** The primary reason for their popularity is the
promise of convenient *"worry free investing"* which rarely keeps up
to the S&P.[^traps]

*"Never buy stocks in a sector or a country where investment funds are
trading at a premium to net asset value."*[^traps] Many times
throughout history - blind pools from 1929, the Asian economic miracle
of the 90s - **mania** has caused people with FUD to invest in assets
at a premium, and in the earlier case without knowledge of investment
allocation. (MacBeth 1999, 10)
