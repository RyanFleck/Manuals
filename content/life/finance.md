# This is Not Financial Advice

If you follow any of this, you are entirely responsible for any gains
or losses that you experience. **I hold no accountability.** Thanks.

## FUD - Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt

## Fear & Greed

When people see *"green line go up"*, they want in on the action.
Depending on the timing, this is either an OK or a **bad** time to buy
an asset. It is rare that, having gone up a double-digit percentage,
any asset will continue upwards without considerable momentum or reason.

- Don't pile money into assets when the market is green and greed is high.
- Don't sell everything when the market is red and fear is high.

This is how chumps, suckers, and those manipulated by FUD think. Use
the [Fear & Greed](https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed) index
as a tool to help judge the market. Better put by *Warren Buffett*[^1]:

- *"Be fearful when others are greedy."*
- *"Be greedy **only** when others are fearful."*
