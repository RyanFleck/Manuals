# John 3

> There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
> Jews.
>
> This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know
> that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs
> that You do unless God is with him."
>
> Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="jesus">"Most assuredly, I say to you,
> unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</span>
>
> Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he
> enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"
>
> Jesus answered, <span class="jesus">"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of
> water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which
> is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit
> is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born
> again.' The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of
> it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is
> everyone who is born of the Spirit."</span>
>
> Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
>
> Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="jesus">"Are you the teacher of Israel, and
> do not know these things? Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak
> what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive
> Our witness. If I have told you earthly things and you do not
> believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span>
>
> <span class="jesus">No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that
> is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the
> serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
> that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal
> life. **For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
> Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have
> everlasting life.**</span>
>
> <span class="jesus">For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world,
> but that the world through Him might be saved.</span>
>
> <span class="jesus">He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe
> is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the
> only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the
> light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
> light, because their deeds were evil. **For everyone practicing evil
> hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds
> should be exposed.** But he who does the truth comes to the light,
> that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in
> God."</span>
>
> After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of
> Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized.
>
> Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was
> much water there. And they came and were baptized.
>
> For John had not yet been thrown into prison. Then there arose a
> dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews about
> purification. And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who
> was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified--behold,
> He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!"
>
> John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing unless it has
> been given to him from heaven. You yourselves bear me witness, that
> I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before Him.'
> He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the
> bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of
> the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.
>
> He must increase, but I must decrease.
>
> He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is
> earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above
> all. And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one
> receives His testimony. He who has received His testimony has
> certified that God is true.
>
> For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not
> give the Spirit by measure. The Father loves the Son, and has given
> all things into His hand. He who believes in the Son has everlasting
> life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but
> the wrath of God abides on him."

# Discernment

> The first one to plead his cause seems right, Until his neighbor
> comes and examines him.
>
> -- Proverbs 18:17 NKJV

<br />

> Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart
> from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of
> demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience
> seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to
> abstain from foods which God created to be received with
> thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
>
> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if
> it is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word
> of God and prayer.
>
> -- 1 Timothy 4:1-5 NKJV

<br />

> I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you
> in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, which is not another;
> but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of
> Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
> gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be
> accursed.
>
> As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any
> other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be
> accursed. For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please
> men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of
> Christ.
>
> -- Galatians 1:6-10 NKJV

<br />

> Now I urge you, brethren, note those who cause divisions and
> offenses, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and avoid
> them.
>
> For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their
> own belly, and by smooth words and flattering speech deceive the
> hearts of the simple.
>
> -- Romans 16:17-18 NKJV
