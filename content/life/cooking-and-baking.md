# Grocery & Meal Planning

Everybody wants to eat, and sometimes life gets busy! Especially as a
student with a tight budget and other high priorities, feeding
yourself properly with a minimum of time and effort is crucial. Even
for "adults", having a plan will help to cut down on wasted food and
reduce your decision fatigue.

## Tier 0: Not Dying

If you are utterly devoid of motivation, broke, and just want to
survive, avoid sustaining yourself on snacks and crap - go to the
grocery store *once* and pick up the following food items. Following
this plan will keep you reasonably well fed at a good nutritional
baseline, while saving time with store-bought bread and frozen
vegetables.

This assumes you only have a few kitchen basics and a coffee maker of
some kind. Keeping your space clean is essential to reducing the
amount of time it takes to make your food. Neglecting to clean and
piling up dishes and dirt is extremely demotivating, and will end with
you opting for takeout and a deteriorating body.

*A warm cup of coffee in the morning is important for morale.*

# Breads

## Sourdough

# Cookies

# Pie

## Butter Crusts

Or *pie dough* - enough for two pies.

**Ingredients:**

- ½ pound butter
- 2½ cups flour
- ½ tbsp sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- 7 tbsp ice water

**Instructions:**

1. In food processor, pulse dry ingredients (flour, sugar, and salt)
2. Pulse in butter. Cut the butter into ~1cm² chunks, throw them into the food processor, and tap the pulse button until coarse crumbs form. Not long. 
3. Check to make sure there is no tough disk stuck to the bottom of the food processing chamber.
3. Pulse in water. Stop when clumps form - longer will destroy the flaky texture
4. Divide into two balls and refrigerate
5. Chill for 45m-1h

1. Place strips of bacon in cold pan
