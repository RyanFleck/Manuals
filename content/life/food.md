# Grocery & Meal Planning

Everybody wants to eat, and sometimes life gets busy! Especially as a
student with a tight budget and other high priorities, feeding
yourself properly with a minimum of time and effort is crucial. Even
for "adults", having a plan will help to cut down on wasted food,
reduce your decision fatigue, and bring some structure to your life.

Additionally - any of these meals can be split in a pinch. There are
few things that are more kind and wonderful than sharing a meal and
dinnertime conversation with your roommates or loved ones. We don't
get much time here to figure out what is really important.

> So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or
> of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.
>
> -- 2 Corinthians 9:7 NKJV

## Tier 0: Not Dying

If you are utterly devoid of motivation, broke, and just want to
survive, avoid sustaining yourself on snacks and crap - go to the
grocery store *once* and pick up the following food items. Following
this plan will keep you reasonably well fed at a good nutritional
baseline, while saving time with store-bought bread and frozen
vegetables.

This assumes you only have a few kitchen basics and a coffee maker of
some kind. Keeping your space clean is essential to reducing the
amount of time it takes to make your food. Neglecting to clean and
piling up dishes and dirt is extremely demotivating, and will end with
you opting for takeout and a deteriorating body.

*A warm cup of coffee in the morning is important for morale.*

### Your Kitchen

To cook cheap and nutritious meals for yourself, ensure you have the
following items in your kitchen already.

- A clean kitchen with a functional stove and sink
- Frying pan
- Small pot with lid
- A rice cooker (a cheap one will do)
- Spatula
- Cutting board
- Knife
- Coffee maker
- Toaster (or toaster oven)
- Plate, fork, knife
- Rags or paper towels
- Dish soap
- Zip-lock freezer bags
- Some tupperware containers for leftovers
- Spices and other essentials:
  - Olive oil
  - Salt and pepper
  - Chili powder
  - Coffee filters
  - Beef stock/bouillon
  - Soya sauce
  - Sriracha / hot sauce (for your eggs)

- To save time you can always chop all your vegetables at once and
  keep them in a big tupperware.
- Add frozen mixed vegetables to increase the volume of all these
  dishes, and/or when too lazy to chop.

![What your cart should contain for Tier 0](/images/groceries/haul-min.jpg)

### Spaghetti and Sausage

Use half of your sausage, some vegetables, and the pasta sauce to
create a rich and filling pasta meal.

### Chicken stir fry

Fry up half of your chicken breasts, some vegetables, and soy sauce in
your fry pan. Serve over your asian noodles.

### Sausage skillet[^1] over potatoes

Boil some potatoes, then fry them up in a pan with sausage and vegetables.

### Bachelor style Chili

Chop up some onions and 1/3 kg of ground beef and fry them in butter
in a pot. Add beans, half a bean-tin of water, crush two tomatoes with
your bare hand into the pot, some frozen vegetables, and chili powder.
Bring to a boil and simmer for 40-60 minutes. Serve with buttered
toast.

### Chicken Vegetable Pasta

Cube your chicken breasts and cook with onions, vegetables, and soy
sauce in a pan. Start boiling water for pasta when you start cooking
your chicken. Combine everything and toss in your frying pan.

### Ground Beef and Onion Noodles

Cook up ground beef, onions, and soy sauce in a pan.

### Fish and Chips

Boil up some potatoes for less time then usual. Slice into wedge fries
and stick them into the oven beside the fish you bought - and follow
the instructions on the battered fish box.


# Breads

## Sourdough

# Cookies

# Pie

## Butter Crusts

Or *pie dough* - enough for two pies.

**Ingredients:**

- ½ pound butter
- 2½ cups flour
- ½ tbsp sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- 7 tbsp ice water

**Instructions:**

1. In food processor, pulse dry ingredients (flour, sugar, and salt)
2. Pulse in butter. Cut the butter into ~1cm² chunks, throw them into the food processor, and tap the pulse button until coarse crumbs form. Not long.
3. Check to make sure there is no tough disk stuck to the bottom of the food processing chamber.
3. Pulse in water. Stop when clumps form - longer will destroy the flaky texture
4. Divide into two balls and refrigerate
5. Chill for 45m-1h
