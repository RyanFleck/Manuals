# The Body

Training the body and building yourself physically is crucial to
keeping a sharp mind. The mind is part of the body, and when the body
fails, the mind also is impaired. Allowing it to deteriorate, sitting
in a chair day in and day out, is *no good.*

> accord.
>
> -- Socrates [^1]

> Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
> who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For
> you were bought at a price; therefore **glorify God in your body** and
> in your spirit, which are God's.

> -- 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 NKJV

## Consistency is Key

Disciplined **consistency** is the name of the game when it comes to
fitness. A regimen must be established and kept, or else you will
succumb to habit and decision fatigue.

## Measure It

Also critical to building health is **tracking** your progress. As the
old management adage goes - *"If you can't measure it, you can't
improve it."*[^2]

Measurement is also key to keeping **motivation** high. Seeing
yourself improve, especially when weightlifting, is highly rewarding
psychologically.

# Calisthenics

When forming a habit, or deciding on a workout routine, the time to
begin the exercise plays a large factor in how easy the habit will be
to keep up. Calisthenic exercise has the huge advantage of being able
to begin instantly and anywhere - no commute or money required.

I have done sports and strength training in my day, but calisthenics
offers freedom from paid gyms, recreation centers, and even home gyms.
If you can pick up some dumbells or install a chin-up bar, that would
be fantastic.

# Running

- Start with [Couch to 5k](https://c25k.com/), a 9 week baseline
  establishing program
- A GPS watch is a fantastic tool to assess your progress

# Fighting

**There is no substitute.** Training to fight instills toughness,
courage, and quick thinking. Combat sports can take a serious toll on
your mental acuity, but with care the benefits massively outweigh the
risks. Nothing raises your assertiveness like taking a hit.

If in Calgary I recommend [Champion's
Creed](https://championscreed.ca/), where I trained for half a year
myself as a novice under Chad Anheliger. The gym is friendly to
beginners with watchful and mature staff who are able to quickly
correct any dangerous behaviour.
