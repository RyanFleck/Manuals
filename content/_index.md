I have decided to collect my notes for a variety of courses and subjects in a single public place for easy reference and sharing.

If knowledge is gained at great personal cost (in long, tiresome lectures,) why not share the distilled product? This page, dear reader, is gifted to you in hopes that it speeds your learning or clarifies some obscure point.
