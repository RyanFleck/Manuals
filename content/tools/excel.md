# Introduction {#introduction}

Man has always had the spreadsheet for working purposes. If you peer
backwards into history, you will find **cruneiform tablets with
spreadsheets on them**. Tables are an endlessly useful and logical way
to organize the material world. In the new industrial era, **Microsoft
Excel** has become the humble program to take this crown, being the
preferred format for companies of all sizes to practically and
effectively complete their work.

Martin Shkreli has a [Finance Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI_riscmviI&list=PLJsVF3gZDcuTxcdH5FmQRTd6MiJ29X_OQ) playlist[^fn:1] with a focus on
Excel.

Like all Microsoft Office products, Excel can be automated with VBA,
**Visual Basic for Applications**, which is the primary topic of this
manual. Visual Basic was first released in 1991 as an easy way (akin
to BASIC) to work with Microsoft products and develop Windows
applications.[^fn:2]

Honestly, I never expected to dig into this stuff. I assumed my
knowledge of VB/VBA would never extend past this meme, but here we
are -

# What are Macros? {#what-are-macros}

Generally - across programming - macros (from the Ancient Greek
"makros" meaning long) are meant to simplify a longer activity. In
Excel, they are more akin to the concept of _automation scripting_ - the
UI is puppeteered with functions and code to complete a repetitive or
difficult task.

**Examples:**

-   Automatically formatting a report every time new data is added.
-   Copying and pasting data across sheets without manual effort.
-   Generating and sending automated emails based on Excel data.
-   Importing and cleaning up data from external sources.


# Writing Simple Macros with VBA {#writing-simple-macros-with-vba}

Before starting, let's set up Excel for some _hacking_.

1.  **Enable the developer menu** at File, Options, Customize Ribbon, and
    check the `Developer` option to include it in the _ribbon_.
2.  **Hit Alt-F11.** This will open the VBA editor.
3.  Ensure your file is saved as **xlsm**. If you do not **save as xlsm** all
    of your macros will be lost if you close the file.

Generally in this section we will cover the following:

-   How to record a macro
-   Editing recorded macros in VBA
-   Assigning macros to buttons and shortcuts
-   The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor
-   VBA syntax and structure
-   Variables, data types, and scope
-   Conditional statements (If/Else, Select Case)
-   Loops (For, While, Do Until)


## Recording a Simple Macro {#recording-a-simple-macro}

In your sample document (whatever you want) click `Developer > Record
Macro`, don't bother setting a shortcut, and perform a few actions.
Then hit `Developer > Stop Recording`. You can view the code for this
macro by (assuming this is a fresh project) hitting `Alt-F11` and
looking in `Module1` for the generated code.

```vba
Sub Macro1()
   '
   ' Macro1 Macro
   ' Set Column Types
   '

   ' Set the column to date format
   Columns("A:A").Select
   Selection.NumberFormat = "m/d/yyyy"
   Columns("A:A").EntireColumn.AutoFit
   ' Set the top item in the column
   Range("A1").Select
   Selection.NumberFormat = "General"
   Selection.Font.Bold = True
End Sub
```

_Aside:_ Save your macros in your Emacs configs with `M-x insert-kbd-macro`


## Assigning Macros to Buttons {#assigning-macros-to-buttons}

To reassign the macro to another keybinding in the future, you can hit
`Developer > Macros` and in the `Options` for your macro edit the shortcut
and description.

Form buttons can be added to sheets with `Developer > Insert > Button
(Form Control)` - clicking the button will then run the macro.


## The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor {#the-visual-basic-for-applications--vba--editor}

The entire Excel/VBA interop system can be accessed and manipulated
from the VBA editor, which can be opened with `Alt + F11`. On the left, in
the **Project** pane, you will see an object for each sheet in your
workbook along with one for the entire workbook.

**Useful Commands** (M - Meta/Alt, C - Control, S - Shift)

## VBA Embedded Project Structure {#vba-embedded-project-structure}

The VBA Editor enables you to edit a tree of VBA files corresponding
to:

1.  One **Workbook** object for the entire file, a "Workbook"
2.  **Sheet** objects for each sheet in the file
3.  **Modules** which store macros, functions, and subroutines
4.  **UserForms** are collections of custom UI elements
5.  **Class Modules** define custom objects

Within **Workbook** and **Sheet** files, you can add event-triggered
functions that are tied to the entire file or a specific sheet.

-   `Workbook_Open` triggers when the file is opened
-   `Workbook_BeforeClose` triggers before closing
-   `Workbook_SheetChange` detects cell edits
-   `Worksheet_Change` within a sheet's file runs after an edit
-   `Worksheet_SelectionChange` triggers when a cell is selected

All macros and automation logic should be stored in **Modules**. Use your
head and split code between modules in a sensible manner.

```vba
Private Sub Workbook_Open()
   MsgBox "Welcome! This workbook opened successfully.", vbInformation, "Hello!"
End Sub
```

```vba
Dim var1 As Integer
var1 = 2
userInput = InputBox("Test")

Debug.Print "User input was: " & userInput & " and var1 is " & var1
```


## Variables, data types, functions, and scope {#variables-data-types-functions-and-scope}

VBA has the same data types as any programming language. See this
[cheat sheet page](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/vba-cheat-sheet/#data) for a good set of examples. Notably:

-   The `Variant` type can take anything (and is the default type)
-   Booleans are capitalized `True` and `False`
-   Strings use double quotes unlike other Microsoft products
-   Dates are `M/D/YYYY` - very American
-   There are three special Excel data types:
    -   `Range("A1:A4")`
    -   `Worksheet("Boiler 1")`
    -   `Workbooks(1)`

All variables are created in a given scipe. When they lose scope, the
value is garbage-collected. You can use the following to declare
variables:

-   [Dim](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/dim-statement) for procedure-level variables
-   [Static](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/static-statement) to preserve values between calls

Procedures are contained within:

-   [Sub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/sub-statement) (Sub-procedure[^fn:3])
-   [Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/function-statement) blocks (which by default handle args as pass-by-reference)

...both of which can be [called](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/concepts/getting-started/calling-sub-and-function-procedures) in a similar manner.

```vba
' Sub procedure definition with two arguments:
Sub SubComputeArea(Length, TheWidth)

   Dim Area As Double ' Declare local variable.

   If Length = 0 Or TheWidth = 0 Then
      ' If either argument = 0.
      Exit Sub ' Exit Sub immediately.
   End If

   Area = Length * TheWidth ' Calculate area of rectangle.
   Debug.Print Area ' Print Area to Debug window.
End Sub
```


## Conditional statements (If/Else, Select Case) {#conditional-statements--if-else-select-case}

This example is from the [VBA Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/concepts/getting-started/using-ifthenelse-statements#testing-a-second-condition-if-the-first-condition-is-false):

```vba
Function Bonus(performance, salary)
   If performance = 1 Then
      Bonus = salary * 0.1
   ElseIf performance = 2 Then
      Bonus = salary * 0.09
   ElseIf performance = 3 Then
      Bonus = salary * 0.07
   Else
      Bonus = 0
   End If
End Function

' In a subroutine:
Debug.Print Bonus(1, 2390) '-> 239
```


## Loops (For, While, Do Until) {#loops--for-while-do-until}


## Simple User I/O {#simple-user-i-o}

Here is a very simple example of a macro that shows a pop-up input box
to the user, and after hitting OK, presents the same data to the user.

```vba
Sub Macro4()
   Dim response As String
   response = InputBox("Write anything.")
   MsgBox ("Your input: " & response)
End Sub
```


# Manipulating Tables in VBA {#manipulating-tables-in-vba}

-   The Object Model (Workbooks, Worksheets, Ranges)
-   Selecting, copying, and formatting cells
-   Manipulating rows, columns, and tables


## The Object Model (Workbooks, Worksheets, Ranges) {#the-object-model--workbooks-worksheets-ranges}


## Selecting, copying, and formatting cells {#selecting-copying-and-formatting-cells}


## Manipulating rows, columns, and tables {#manipulating-rows-columns-and-tables}


# Common Tasks {#common-tasks}


## Finding Columns {#finding-columns}

```vba
Function FindColumnByName(sheet As Worksheet, columnName As String) As Integer
   Dim rng As Range
   Dim lastCol As Integer

   ' Find the last column in the first row
   lastCol = sheet.Cells(1, sheet.Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column

   ' Loop through the first row to find the column name
   For Each rng In sheet.Range(sheet.Cells(1, 1), sheet.Cells(1, lastCol))
      If Trim(LCase(rng.Value)) = Trim(LCase(columnName)) Then
	 FindColumnByName = rng.Column
	 Exit Function
      End If
   Next rng

   ' Return 0 if column not found
   FindColumnByName = 0
End Function

Sub TestFindColumn()
   Debug.Print FindColumnByName(Sheet1, "Paystop") '-> 3
End Sub
```


# Power Automate {#power-automate}

Power Automate is a shiny new toy from Microsoft that enables the easy
creation of macro-style event-driven workflows in the cloud. While not
as powerful as macros, there are a certain number of useful tasks that
can be performed with power automate.
