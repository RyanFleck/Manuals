# Why use AWS?

While it would be cheaper to deploy your new web app on a cloud VM you configure on your own, or easier to use an intermediate layer like Heroku, AWS allows you to deploy and massively scale with ease _for money._

As a developer, AWS skills are currently in high demand, and those with AWS skills can earn big and be snapped up by prestigious organizations.

**Common AWS services and their use cases:**

1. **VPC** - Private network within AWS, EC2s exist within VPCs
2. **EC2** - Elastic compute cloud allows you to create containers to run web applications or other programs
3. **RDS** - Relational database service, runs SQL of some sort
4. **Route 53**  - Manages DNS queries, can redirect based on region, latency, etc.
5. **Lambda**  - Run one-off computations instead of using an EC2
6. **S3** - Simple Storage Service, for keeping user data like profile pictures or miscellaneous files
7. **Glacier** - Long term data archival service for compliance or backups
8. **CloudWatch** - Monitor all AWS services and set up automated actions

**Compared to other cloud providers, AWS has the following advantages:**

1. It's the largest and most mature vendor by a large margin (\~1/3  of the market)
2. Very competitive pricing due to scale

Getting certified with AWS is a popular way to advance your career as a software engineer. The most popular certification to get is [_AWS Certified Solutions Architect_](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) which validates that you can deploy a secure and scalable app on AWS.

This set of notes will draw heavily from this [_AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C02 \[2022\]_](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-hands-on/) course which I was able to access for free while working at IBM.
