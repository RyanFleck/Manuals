# Why use AWS?

While it would be cheaper to deploy your new web app on a cloud VM you configure on your own, or easier to use an intermediate layer like Heroku, AWS allows you to deploy and massively scale with ease _for money._

Common AWS services and their use cases:

1. **VPC** - Private network within AWS, EC2s exist within VPCs
2. **EC2** - Elastic compute cloud allows you to create containers to run web applications or other programs
3. **RDS** - Relational database service, runs SQL of some sort
4. **Route 53**  - Manages DNS queries, can redirect based on region/latency/etc
