# Why Snowflake? {#why-snowflake}

-   Fully managed: no hardware or server provisioning required
-   Compute / storage decoupled
-   Auto-scaling, auto-suspend, etc.
-   Support for semi-structured data (JSON, VARIANT, etc.)
-   Zero-copy cloning, time travel, data sharing
-   Strong ecosystem and connector support


# Key Concepts &amp; Architecture {#key-concepts-and-architecture}

-   Snowsight UI (web interface)
-   SnowSQL (CLI)
-   Notebooks (Snowflake Notebooks)
-   Architecture: hybrid of shared-disk and shared-nothing. Central storage + multiple MPP compute clusters.
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   Cloud Platforms: Runs on AWS, Azure, GCP.
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   Micro-partitions (internal detail)
-   Compute / Storage separation
-   Zero-copy cloning, Time Travel, Fail-safe


## Editions &amp; Pricing {#editions-and-pricing}

-   Editions: Standard, Enterprise, Business Critical, Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS)
-   Pricing model: credits for compute + storage + usage
-   How edition differences affect features (e.g. multi-cluster, data protection)


# Core Objects &amp; DDL {#core-objects-and-ddl}

-   Databases, Schemas, Tables, Views
-   External Tables, Streams, Tasks
-   Sequences, Stages
-   Examples of CREATE / ALTER / DROP
-   Cloning &amp; object versioning


# Data Ingestion / Loading {#data-ingestion-loading}

-   Stages: internal (user, table, named) vs external cloud stages
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   COPY INTO / bulk load
-   Snowpipe (continuous ingestion)
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   Snowpipe Streaming
-   Loading semi-structured data and schema inference


# Querying &amp; DML {#querying-and-dml}

-   SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE
-   Joins, subqueries, functions
-   Working with semi-structured data (VARIANT, OBJECT, ARRAY)
-   Window functions, CTEs, analytic SQL


# Warehouses &amp; Compute {#warehouses-and-compute}

-   What is a warehouse; required for queries / DML
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   Warehouse sizes and billing
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   Auto-suspend, auto-resume

## Performance &amp; Cost Optimization {#performance-and-cost-optimization}

-   Choosing warehouse sizes vs concurrency
-   Pruning / clustering / clustering keys
-   Caching, result caching
-   Query profiling / query history
-   Avoiding overprovisioning / idle compute


# Security &amp; Access Control {#security-and-access-control}

-   Roles, users, grants, privileges
-   Snowflake Documentation
-   Object-level permissions
-   Row access policies, masking policies
-   Network / IP policies, secure views, encryption


# Integration &amp; Connectors {#integration-and-connectors}

-   JDBC, ODBC, Python connector
-   Spark / Snowflake connector
-   Kafka Connector
-   BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, etc.)
-   Data marketplace &amp; data sharing


## Snowpark (Python, Java, Scala APIs) {#snowpark--python-java-scala-apis}


# Advanced Features {#advanced-features}

-   Time Travel &amp; Fail-safe
-   Zero-copy cloning
-   Materialized Views
-   Tasks &amp; scheduled pipelines
-   Search optimization service
-   Streams &amp; Change Data Capture (CDC)


# Tips, Best Practices &amp; Gotchas {#tips-best-practices-and-gotchas}

-   Avoid leaving warehouses running unnecessarily
-   For small queries, very large warehouses may not help
-   Use clustering only when needed
-   Be aware of billing granularity (per second)
-   Watch out for too many small files in load
-   Query patterns that can disrupt performance
