# Snowflake {#snowflake}

**Snowflake** is a cloud native database that provides a wealth of
analytical and data mining features for processing, integrating, and
presenting data. **Data platform** could be used to describe Snowflake, as
it offers features traditionally found in data warehouses, lakes, and
streaming-processing platforms like Kafka.


## COF-C02 - Snowpro Core Certification {#cof-c02-snowpro-core-certification}

You can download the study guide for this exam on the [Snowflake
COF-C02 Exam Guide](https://learn.snowflake.com/en/certifications/snowpro-core) page. This guide is updated frequently, so go and
request your own copy if possible. It is a 100-question, 115-minute test.

Here is a copy from when I initially took the Snowpro Core training:

-   Strong ecosystem and connector support


# Key Concepts &amp; Architecture {#key-concepts-and-architecture}

**Topics:**

-   Snowsight UI (web interface)
-   SnowSQL (CLI)
-   Notebooks (Snowflake Notebooks)
