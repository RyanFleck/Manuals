# What is Maximo?

**IBM Maximo is an EAM (Enterprise Asset Management) solution.**

Heavy industry across the globe must deal with massive inventories with millions of parts, each with different stocking and holding costs, reordering processes, expiry dates, criticalities, and business requirements for counting and inventory management. Balancing all of these variables are systems like IBM Maximo, which aims to maximize the return of all enterprise assets through the optimization of cost, downtime, maintenance, repair material cost, and labor productivity.
