# A Brief Introduction

Power BI is a collaborative cloud Excel that also allows the querying of data from databases and sharing of 'dashboards' which enables up-to-date visualisations of the data manipulated by the user.

# The Interface

The three icons on the left are:

1. **Report** - Graphs and tools to share later.
2. **Data** - Browse tables you have connected to.
3. **Relationships** - Connects different tables and datasources with common fields. The action zone.

The ribbon contains dynamic tools based on the view selected on the left.

The report view allows you to place floating widgets that can align with other elements on the page. Formatting tools appear below the elements.

In the **Report** view there is a **Mobile Layout** option in the View tab that allows you to customize the view of the report when viewed on a phone.

In the Modeling tab you can provide a **'What If?'** interface which gives the frontend user a parameter they can manipulate.
