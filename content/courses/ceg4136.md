Example: Addition and matrix multiplication on shared memory and message passing
systems.

# Architecture Performance

## Amdahl's Law
## Speedup and Efficiency Equations
## Parallelism

Performance is generally given by:

```
Speedup = 1/( (S + P/N)*T )

Where:
  S = Serial computation percentage 
  P = Parallel computation percentage
  N = Number of processors in system

Alternatively:
  Time = Serial Time + (Parallel Time/ N Processors)
```

## Scalability

## Parallel System Classification

The basic types of parallel systems are as follows:

```
SIMD
 Single Instruction, Multiple Data
  A single thread of control applies an operation.
  The operation effects an array of memory locations.
  The operation occurs simultaneously for each element.
   Ex.  A[1:n] = A[1:n] + B[1:n]
```

```
MIMD
 Multiple Instructions, Multiple Data
  Multiple threads of control work on a large set of data.
  Processors periodically synchronize.
   Ex.  forall(i=0; i<n; i++)
```

```
SPMD
 Single Program, Multiple Data
  Many processors execute the same program.
  Multiple threads of control.
   Ex.  if($mem == 0){ dostuff($mem); }
```

# Manycore Cache Coherence

Yes, _manycore_ is not a misspelling of _multicore_, it's a real thing.

## Coherence Bandwidth Requirements
## Broadcast VS Directory Protocols
## L2 Cache Read Hit/Miss Procedures

For private and shared L2 caches.

# Manycore Router Design

- Virtual channel router architecture
- Pipeline stages
- Buffer organization
- Switch organization
- Arbiters and allocators (round-robin arbiter)

# Synchronization

## Mutex
## Barrier
## ISA Implementations
- T&S
- LL & SC
