* Introduction and Warnings

Learning Python is easy and fun - /and yes, you ought to do it!/

As a beginner's step into the world of computers, *Python is amazing*,
enabling a first encounter with the magic of computing. For
statisticians, Python exposes an easy-to-use method to interact with
complex low-level algorithms, a huge boon to productivity. For cubicle
workers, a high-level interface for scripting, simplifying automation
and surpassing the usefulness of any click-based configuration system.

However, be warned - additional /Computer Science/ knowledge is required
to become a good programmer, and if you only ever write Python, you'll
only ever write good code accidentally. Python is a programming
language, and like any other, has strengths and weaknesses. The
greatest strength of the language - its ease of use - also happens to
be the achilles heel of the system. Python enables new, inexperienced,
or foolish users to write terrible rats-nests of logic, built upon
cranky old design methodologies that have long since been proven to be
(at best,) utterly useless boilerplate busywork. If you want to be a
great programmer, you will need to learn a lot more about computers.

This manual was wiped and recreated from scratch in *September 2025*,
when I began using Python daily again after a years-long hiatus from
the language. Focusing on cloud technology, functional programming,
and data engineering has dramatically improved my techniques for
designing systems that are easy to understand and debug, and hold up
in production. Coming back has been equal parts delightful and
disappointing - /Python is not a productivity panacea./

- Take a dive into a functional language like [[/clj/#why-clojure][Clojure]]

* Tooling & Installation

Most of my teams use [[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/][uv]], /"A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools,
pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more."/ I run this
alongside the venerable [[https://asdf-vm.com/][asdf-vm]], which manages my system Python and
every other programming language I use.
