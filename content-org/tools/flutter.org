* What is Flutter?

#+begin_quote
Flutter is an open source framework for building beautiful, natively
compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
#+end_quote

- Read the [[https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/learn-flutter][Flutter docs]]

Flutter is all about building *widget trees*, with out-of-box and custom
widgets. Widgets are objects based on classes, which can be extended.

* What is ClojureDart?

#+begin_quote
ClojureDart is a recent Clojure dialect to make native mobile and
desktop apps using Flutter and the Dart ecosystem.
#+end_quote

- Read the [[https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart/blob/main/doc/quick-start.md][ClojureDart quick start]]
- Read the [[https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart/blob/main/doc/flutter-quick-start.md][ClojureDart + Flutter quick start]]

* Installation

Developing a Flutter app with ClojureDart involves installing Java,
Clojure, Android Studio, XCode (on Mac), and finally Flutter. Mobile
development is complex and requires large, complex toolchains.

- [[https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile][Windows]] (use *choco*)
- [[https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/android][GNU/Linux]] (use *asdf*)
- [[https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-ios][MacOS]] (use *brew*)

...then follow the [[https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart/blob/main/doc/flutter-quick-start.md][ClojureDart Flutter quickstart]].

On GNU/Linux you will also need the `ninja-build` apt package.

* The Developer Experience Factor (DevX)

When evaluating cross-platform mobile app development systems for a
side project, I had an eye out for three key features to keep my
sanity:

1. A short and simple toolchain
2. Easy to access and develop with hardware features (bluetooth)
3. Leverage my existing React knowledge

[[/images/cljd/IMG20241117194238-min.jpg]]

After evaluating **React Native** (+ClojureScript) and **Flutter**
(+ClojureDart) it became abundantly clear that Flutter had a much
shorter and more stable toolchain, significantly less complex
dependency management (JS can be hellish, things break often) and a
more consistent experience across platforms.

[[/images/cljd/IMG20241117191207-min.jpg]]

At first glance, Flutter with ClojureDart seems to be a vastly
superior way for a solo dev to develop mobile apps. Time will tell if
this is true or a large misstep.

* Why Use an Intermediate Language?

To reduce the lines of code required to produce a mobile app. Luckily
the [[https://github.com/D00mch/DartClojure][DartClojure]] project exists to convert dart code to ClojureDart,
it's built into Calva, and the [[https://github.com/burinc/dartclojure.el?tab=readme-ov-file][dartclojure.el]] Emacs package exists to
facilitate easy use.

* Notes on the Fundamentals

These are rough, personal notes - read with caution.

** Hello World

- Every Flutter app must start with ~runApp()~.
- There is ~void main(){}~ to start the app.
- The runApp function accepts a *widget tree*. There is no GUI UI
  builder - everything is done in code. Hooray!

#+begin_src dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main(){
  runApp(MaterialApp());
}
#+end_src

- Instructors are using *screencast mode* in VS Code to help observers
- Flutter has ~pubspec.lock~ which holds package info and *dependencies*

Here's an extremely basic hello world in *dart*:

#+begin_src dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.deepPurple,
        body: Text('Hello World!'))));
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Hit *debug* in VS Code to run the app.

Here's the *exact equivalent* in clojure-dart:

#+begin_src clojure
(ns acme.main
  (:require ["package:flutter/material.dart" :as m]
            [cljd.flutter :as f]))

(defn main []
  (f/run
   (m/MaterialApp
    .title "Welcome to Flutter")
    .home
    (m/Scaffold .backgroundColor m.Colors/deepPurple)
    .body
    (m/Text "Let's get coding! Yahoo!")))
#+end_src

Run ~clj -M:cljd flutter~ to run the app.

See [[file:~/Documents/Flutter_Experiments/clojure-dart/src/acme/main.cljd][main.cljd]] in the test project. Hopefully this makes it clear how
named arguments are represented in ClojureDart versus plain Dart.

A little more example:

#+begin_src clojure
(ns acme.main
  (:require ["package:flutter/material.dart" :as m]
            [cljd.flutter :as f]))

;; clj -M:cljd flutter

(defn main []
  (f/run
   (m/MaterialApp .title "Welcome to Flutter")
    .home
    (m/Scaffold .backgroundColor m.Colors/deepPurple)
    .body
    (m/Container
      .decoration (m/BoxDecoration
                    .gradient (m/LinearGradient
                                .colors [m.Colors/red m.Colors/white]
                                .begin m.Alignment/topLeft)))
    (m/Center)
    (m/Container .decoration (m/BoxDecoration .color m.Colors/red))
    (m/Text "Let's get coding! Yahoo!")))
#+end_src

** Classes, Widgets, Constructor Functions

Typically you want to *break up huge widget trees* by creating your own
widgets. Here's an example of that refactoring:

#+begin_src dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Colors.deepPurple,
      body: Container(
        decoration: const BoxDecoration(
            gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red],
              begin: Alignment.topLeft,
              end: Alignment.bottomRight,
            )),
        child: const Center(
            child: Text("Hello World!",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 30)))),
  )));
}
#+end_src

Widgets are objects, and creating a new widget is the same as
*instantiating* a new object from a class.

#+begin_src dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
       backgroundColor: Colors.deepPurple,
       // Replace the body with our new widget
       body: GradientContainer()
  )));
}

class GradientContainer extends StatelessWidget {
  // MISSING: Constructor Function, see below

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
        decoration: // ... //
        child: const Center(child: Text("Hello World!",
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 30))));
  }
}
#+end_src

The constructor function defines the data that must be passed to our
widget.

- Optional args wrapped in ~[]~
- Default values assigned with ~=~
- Use ~required~ to ensure named parameters are passed

#+begin_src dart
// Positional arguments (required by default)
const GradientContainer(a, b, [c, d=5]);

// Named arguments
const GradientContainer({a, required b, c=3});

// Necessary scaffolding
const GradientContainer({key}): super(key: key);

// Shortcut for the above
const GradientContainer({super.key});
#+end_src

*You can add multiple constructor functions to one class.* By providing
multiple constructors with different defaults, you can easily provide
shortcuts to instantiating slight variations on your widget.

#+begin_src dart
GradientContainer.red({super.key, required this.children}) : colors = [Colors.deepOrange, Colors.red];
#+end_src

*Note:* To organize your project, move your widgets to
 ~lowercase_name.dart~ files. /This is convention./ They can then be
 imported into your main view with a line like the following, using
 your project name:

#+begin_src dart
import 'package:your_flutter_app/gradient_container.dart';
#+end_src

While we are discussing conventions, here are a few:

#+begin_src dart
ClassNames      // Classes start with an uppercase
variableNames   // Variables start with a lowercase

// Ending a variable with '?' allows it to be null
var Alignment startAlignment?;
#+end_src

~const~ means something is a compile-time constant and will not change.
You cannot use const to 'lock' a widget that depends on variables.

*Pass data into classes* with the constructor function:

#+begin_src dart
class GradientContainer extends StatelessWidget {
  const GradientContainer({super.key, required this.children});

  // 'final' means single-assignment
  final List<Widget> children;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
        decoration: const BoxDecoration(
            gradient: LinearGradient(
          colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.red],
          begin: Alignment.topLeft,
          end: Alignment.bottomRight,
        )),
        child: Center(
            child: c.Column(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
              children: children)));
  }
}

// Usage:
GradientContainer(children: [
  Text("Hello World!")
])
#+end_src


** Functions are also just objects

#+begin_src dart
(){} // Can be used inline

void rollDice(){}
#+end_src



** Stateful vs Stateless Widgets

Long story short: Stateless should be used for elements that *will not
change* during their rendering lifetimes.

*Flutter will only update the UI if the ~build~ method is executed again.*

Within a stateful widget, the ~setState~ special function must be used
to prompt a UI update.

#+begin_quote
"Calling setState notifies the framework that the internal state of
this object has changed in a way that might impact the user interface
in this subtree." ([[https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html][docs]])
#+end_quote

#+begin_src dart
import 'package:dchs_flutter_beacon/dchs_flutter_beacon.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart' as c;
import 'package:dice_roller/gradient_container.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'dart:math';

class DiceRoller extends StatefulWidget{
  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() {
    return _DiceRollerState();
  }
}

// Instantiate objects outside your classes
final randomizer = Random();
final beacon = DchsFlutterBeacon();

class _DiceRollerState extends State<DiceRoller> {

  var activeDiceImage = 1;

  String getDiceImagePath(int a){
    return 'assets/images/dice-$a.png';
  }

  void rollDice() async {
    print("Rolling dice...");
    HapticFeedback.heavyImpact();
    SystemSound.play(SystemSoundType.alert);

    // setState prompts a UI update inside this StatefulWidget
    setState(() {
      activeDiceImage = randomizer.nextInt(6) + 1;
      print("Rolled a $activeDiceImage");
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GradientContainer.red(
        children: [

          // A button as a child
              TextButton(
                onPressed: rollDice, // Onpressed can run a function
                style: TextButton.styleFrom(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
                foregroundColor: Colors.white,
                textStyle: const TextStyle(fontSize: 28)
                ),
              child: const Text("Roll Now"))
        ]);
  }
}

#+end_src

** Images and assets

You may include assets organized however you want in your project, but
they must be mentioned in your ~pubspec.yaml~ file like so:

#+begin_src yaml
flutter:
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section:
  assets:
    - assets/images/example-1.png
    - assets/images/example-2.png
#+end_src

These can be included like so:

#+begin_src dart
Image.asset('assets/images/example-2.png')
#+end_src



** Futures and Async/Await

https://dart.dev/libraries/async/async-await#example-asynchronous-functions



** Package Management

In the project root you can run something like this:

#+begin_src bash
flutter pub add dhcs_flutter_beacon
#+end_src

To add a library like [[https://pub.dev/packages/dchs_flutter_beacon][dhcs_flutter_beacon]] ([[https://github.com/dariocavada/dchs_flutter_beacon][gh]]) to your project.

** SQLite

Per this [[https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/sqlite][flutter cookbook article]], you can store and retrieve data
from SQLite with the ~sqflite~ package.

#+begin_src bash
flutter pub add sqflite path
#+end_src

** Reading and Writing Files

Per the flutter cookbook article '[[https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/reading-writing-files][reading and writing files]]', use the
~path_provider~ and ~file_picker~ package on mobile to provide this. The
packages should automatically ask for permissions when they are required.

- [[https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker][file_picker]]
- [[https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider][path_provider]]

#+begin_src dart
String? selectedDirectory = await FilePicker.platform.getDirectoryPath();
#+end_src

** User Preferences

Automatically wraps platform-specific user data storage to keep
key-value pairs.
