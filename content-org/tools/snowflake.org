* Snowflake

*Snowflake* is a cloud native database that provides a wealth of
analytical and data mining features for processing, integrating, and
presenting data. *Data platform* could be used to describe Snowflake, as
it offers features traditionally found in data warehouses, lakes, and
streaming-processing platforms like Kafka.

** COF-C02 - Snowpro Core Certification

You can download the study guide for this exam on the [[https://learn.snowflake.com/en/certifications/snowpro-core][Snowflake
COF-C02 Exam Guide]] page. This guide is updated frequently, so go and
request your own copy if possible. It is a 100-question, 115-minute test.

Here is a copy from when I initially took the Snowpro Core training:
